                <p>Database project - My team and I created a database from scratch to track purchases for a taco truck. Accurately tracking these purchases makes it easier for owners to keep inventory and make business decisions.</p>
                <p>Costing system project - My team and I interviewed a local business, The Tower Energy and Nutrition, and recommended an evidence based costing system based on vital components of the business.</p>
                <p>AMC Business Analysis - My team and I looked at the financial statements and quarterly reports of AMC to create a SWOT analysis and recommendations on how to improve AMC's general cash flow and growth.</p>
